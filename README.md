# The Arcade Playground

In this project, i tried to implement some arcade games playable in the browser using vanilla Javascript.
Until now, the implemented games are **Snake** and **Flappy Bird**.
				
These games use Frame-by-frame animation and are based on events to handle user commands and collisions.
